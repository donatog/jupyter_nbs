## Open In Colab Badge

Anybody can open a copy of any github-hosted notebook within Colab. To make it easier to give people access to live views of GitHub-hosted notebooks,
colab provides a [shields.io](http://shields.io/)-style badge, which appears as follows:

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/googlecolab/colabtools/blob/master/notebooks/colab-github-demo.ipynb)

The markdown for the above badge is the following:

```markdown
[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/googlecolab/colabtools/blob/master/notebooks/colab-github-demo.ipynb)
```

The HTML equivalent is:

```HTML
<a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/googlecolab/colabtools/blob/master/notebooks/colab-github-demo.ipynb">
  <img src="https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg" alt="Open In Colab"/>
</a>
```

Remember to replace the notebook URL in this template with the notebook you want to link to.
